## About Me

I am currently a Phd student in Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, advised by [Prof.Karol Myszkowski](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~karol/). I received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Peking University, advised by [Prof.Ronggang Wang](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1012/1090.htm), in 2020 and B.S. degree in information engineering from the University of Electronic and Science of China, in 2017. I was lucky to spend time as a research intern at Tencent Robotics Lab from Dec 2019 to June 2020. I had an academic visiting to [Spatial Intelligence Lab](https://ucalgary.ca/labs/spatial-intelligence/home) from May 2016 to Sep 2016, advised by [Prof.Ruisheng Wang](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/ruisheng-wang).
