I also work closely with [Prof.Ana Serrano](https://ana-serrano.github.io/) and [Dr.Thomas Leimk√ºhler](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~tleimkue/). I received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Peking University, advised by [Prof.Ronggang Wang](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2147.htm), in 2020 and B.S. degree in information engineering from the University of Electronic and Science of China, in 2017. I was a Research Scientist Intern at Adobe's Next Cam Lab from July 2024 to September 2024, working under my manager [Marc Levoy](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~levoy/) and mentor [Cecilia Zhang](https://ceciliavision.github.io/). Prior to that, I interned as an Algorithm Research Scientist at Tencent's Robotics X Lab from December 2019 to June 2020, under the mentorship of [Yonggen Ling](https://ygling2008.github.io/).
